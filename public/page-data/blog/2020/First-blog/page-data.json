It had been widely adressed by the data community due to its growing importance to all companies collecting personal and sensitive information. \n\nWhile structured data is standardized and relatively easy to anonymize, dealing with unstructured data is more tedious. There is no database schema that can be used to measure privacy risk. In this blog, I propose to use a named-entity recognition system (NER) to automatically detect textual confidential attributes such as identifiers, sensitive information, etc. In this case study, i will consider that those confidential information to be detected are disease names in medical diagnoses.\n\n# Named-Entity Recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (also known as entity identification) seeks to identify and classify words in an unstructured text into pre-defined categories. In our example, we are looking to identify disease names. Thus, our problem is equivalent to a binary classification of names.\n\n> In humans a series of conditions related to `hormonal dysfunction **(DISEASE)**` as undescended testis , decreased spermatogenesis , `testicular cancer __(DISEASE)__` and <DISONLY> endometriosis </DISONLY> have increased in incidence during the last decades .||DISONLY\n\n\n\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is a challenging learning problem. One the one hand, in most languages and domains, there is only a very small amount of supervised training data available.\n\nSpecify the use of new in our approach \n\nGlobal schema of the solution\n\n## Data set\n\nTalk about the dataset and a schema of labeled data with an example\n\nCode to generate data\n\n# Conditional Random Field\n\nExplain the theory behind the algo\n\nGive code of algo\n\n# Results and conclusion \n\nState-of-the-art named entity recognition systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge in order to learn effectively from the small, supervised training corpora that are available.\n\n\n\n ","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/First-blog/","editLink":"https://github.com/hamzamassaoudi/hmassaoudi.com/edit/master/src/pages/blog/2020/First-blog.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ANONYMIZATION OF TEXT DATA USING NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION","date":"January 08, 2020","excerpt":"Using CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD ALGORITHM TO ANONYMIZE SENSITIVE INFORMATION","cardimage":{"publicURL":"/static/serverless-r-card-f220399b0ac4f032247e665ab77912d5.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020/First-blog/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/ANONYMIZATION OF TEXT DATA USING NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ANONYMIZATION OF TEXT DATA USING NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION"}},"next":null}}}
